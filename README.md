# TensorFlow-ALPR

The project developed using TensorFlow to detect the License Plate from a car and uses the Tesseract Engine to recognize the charactes from the detected plate.

### Software Packs Needed

* <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/download/'>Anaconda 3</a> (**Tool comes with most of the required python packages along with python3 & spyder IDE**)<br>
* <a href='https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract'>Tesseract Engine</a> (**Must need to be installed**)<br>

### Python Packages Needed

* <a href='https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow'>Tensorflow</a><br>
* <a href='https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python'>openCV</a><br>
* <a href='https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract'>pytesseract</a><br>
* <a href='https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg'>labelImg</a><br>

### ABOUT PROJECT

TensorFlow is an open-source software library **(Deep learning)** for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. So we have planned to use it for number plate detection.
